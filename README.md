Effective Spring Workshop Samples
=================================
This repository contains code from the Effective Spring Workshop that I presented at UberConf 2013.

There are three projects in this repository:

 - clean : A clean(ish) set of samples written outside of the workshop.
 - uberconf1 : The workshop code from part 1, as it was written at UberConf 2013; dirty, rough, and bugs included.
 - uberconf2 : The workshop code from part 2, as it was written at UberConf 2013; dirty, rough, and bugs included.
